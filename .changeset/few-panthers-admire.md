Removes Critters which facilitates automatic CSS inlining in prod.

Unfortunately Critters has not been updated for Webpack v5, resulting in a precarious dependency situation that causes issues for NPM users. As such, Critters will be removed for the time being.

It may be updated or we may switch to a fork, but for now, it's causing issues and will require some work to correct.
